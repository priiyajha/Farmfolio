        It is not easy being a farmer . . .
         (small text)---
         Despite the critical role of agriculture in sustaining communities and economies,
          farmers as well as domestic cultivators encounter significant hurdles. 
          They face challenges in selecting the most suitable crops to grow, 
          diagnosing issues with their crops, and accessing the necessary products 
          for cultivation. Limited access to relevant information, personalized guidance, 
          and a platform for purchasing farming-related products restricts farmers' 
          ability to make informed decisions. This often leads to suboptimal crop choices 
          and reduced yields.
